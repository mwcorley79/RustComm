# RustCommExperiments
Repository holds three synchronous Tcp-based message-passing communication crates with different design strategies
- variable message sizes and buffered transfers
- vaiable message sizes without buffering
- fixed sized messages with buffering

Status: essentially complete.  Minor code clean-up and publishing performance stats remain.
